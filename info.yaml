    tasks/questions:
        - How do I judge performance based on the graphs (figure out the metrics)
        - Confirm the env_settings are correct for the 5 non-lunar lander env's
        - Change the loss (search "BOOKMARK")
        - rerun everything and evaluate

            Hey y'all, in our last conversation, we discussed changing the loss function for the dynamics model P to the following:
            loss(P) = Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(P(s_t, a_t))) - Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(s_{t+1}))

            Although in thinking about this a little more, I think the summands should be switched so it is 
            loss(P) = Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(s_{t+1})) - Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(P(s_t, a_t)))

            And in this case, I think we can drop the first summand since its differential wrt P is 0. so our loss becomes
            loss(P) = - Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(P(s_t, a_t)))
            loss = q_value(next_state, choose_action(predict_state(state, action)) )

            Do you agree with this? Anyways, I did try this and while the Q(s_{t+1}, \pi(P(s_t, a_t))) does seem to increase over the training of P (eg it's learning), our AFRL prediction forecast does worse than baseline.
